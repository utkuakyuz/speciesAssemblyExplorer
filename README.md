# Species Assembly Explorer

This repository inlcudes two distinct projects. Both projects are fetching data from Ensembl. I first developed HTML file and then decided to move through React-TS to enhance UI and scalability.

## HTML-JS-CSS single page Assembly Explorer

This project using simple pure JavaScript to fetch data from Ensembl database and show in HTML file. 

## React-TS-ShadCN SPA Assembly Explorer

A React app to fetch and show data from Ensembl Database. Included to have more appealing and accessible UI. Also the code is more scalable, maintainable and readable.

React app is deployed to netlify, you can check it out:
